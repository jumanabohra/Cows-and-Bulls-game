# Cows-and-Bulls-game

 A small game played at the last page of my notebook turned into a simple code.
 
 **How to play?**
 
 Usually there are two players in the game. Using the code you can play against computer. The computer thinks of a random four digit number. Each digit of which is unique i.e. non repeating, between 0-9 (eg. 5346). The victory point is when you guess the number right. The computer asks you to guess the number. You can type any four digit number at first (eg. 1368). The computer will reply you that how many cows and how many bulls does this number have, where:
 Cow: how many digits match with the digits in the final number and are in the incorrect position,
 Bull: How many digits match and are also at the right position as in the final number.
 
 eg: when your guessed number is 1368 and the original number is 5346, 6 is the digit which is present in the final number but is at its incoorect position. So your guessed number has 1 cow. 3 is the digit which matches and is also at the correct position, so your gussed number has 1 cow and 1 bull. This is what the computer will reply. Then you guess your second number accordingly and with these chain of guessess and computer replies of cows and bulls, you get a pattern and eventually the right number.
